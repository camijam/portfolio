        <h2 id="behind-cross-cultur">What is behind cross-cultural communication</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
            The point of understanding a culture must <a
                href="https://www.languagemagazine.com/blurring-the-line-between-language-and-culture/" class="link"
                target="_blank">go beyond simply understanding the language.</a>
            This means that translating web content is not enough if it is not culturally adapted. As
            human beings, we undoubtedly identify with our collective belief systems. For example, the
            place where we are born, the way we speak or what we learned as children. All of this
            creates social codes unique to our country or our group that makes us identify and represent
            us as a unique community.
        </p>

        <h2 id="product-design">Product design using cross-cultural communication</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Cross-cultural design has a huge importance in the perception of users. Colors, symbols or
            the organization of the content have a great influence on the user experience and
            understanding of our message. For example, in web design, the way content is presented to
            users in the United States may not be the same as it is to users in China. A proper
            understanding of culture will make us understand that we perceive differently and to achieve
            a good interaction with our users we need to understand them first.</p>

        <h2 id="meaning">Meaning of colors</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Colors are a very big topic in cross-cultural communication. Thus, the same color can have a
            different meaning according to the culture. It is interesting and at the same time it is
            necessary to be careful as this can completely impact the message we want to share. You
            should always keep in mind <a href="https://mastertcloc.unistra.fr/2022/04/21/color-psychology-in-ux/" class="link" target="_blank">how to choose the right color</a> combination and the best way is
            through research.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Additionally, some techniques for <a href="https://mastertcloc.unistra.fr/2023/03/10/4-ways-to-improve-ux-designs/" class="link" target="_blank">blending user experience-centered design and color</a> can
            be the key of our communication strategy. At the end of the day, the combination of
            psychology, design and understanding of culture has yielded great results in creating
            communications and designs that impact all cultures.</p>

            <h2 id="no-scope">When cross-cultural communication is not in the scope</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Disregarding culture and employing a cross-cultural communication strategy has terrible
                consequences. When a company embarks on the internationalization of a product or service,
                the capital investment is enormous and there are many cases of monetary losses. For
                example, <a href="https://www.originsinfo.com.au/lost-in-translation-soft-drinks-hard-lessons/" class="link" target="_blank">in 1950 Pepsi lost the Asian market</a> by changing the color of its product to light
                blue, the meaning of which in this continent is related to death. This reinforces the need for
                proper research before launching a campaign in another culture.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">
                In conclusion, in this article we address several issues that are important in cross-cultural
                communication. On the one hand, the importance behind cross-cultural communication. The
                power and importance of UX design and, additionally, the added value of colors and their
